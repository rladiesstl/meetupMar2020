Uber is bringing a new ride option to St. Louis on Friday. For a couple hours at least.
From noon to 2 p.m. that day, users will have the option of summoning an UberPitch car.
It won't really go anywhere - maybe just a few trips around the block. But it will have its very own venture capitalist
in the back seat.
And for 15 minutes, that financier will listen to the ideas and dreams of the would-be entrepreneur.
It's an idea that's been used a few times in other cities, including San Francisco and Philadelphia, by the popular
ride-hailing service, which set up shop in St. Louis in September.
Sagar Shah, general manager for the local operation, said there will be six cars equipped with venture capitalists
roaming St. Louis city and county during the two-hour window.
There aren't any waiting lists. And appointments can't be scheduled. It's just a matter of using the Uber app.
Based on the response in other cities, he said it's likely there will be more ride requests than can be
accommodated during the two-hour window.
"If you don't see a car immediately, keep checking the app," Shah said.
Uber's partners in the program are Lewis & Clark Ventures, Cultivation Capital, Prosper Women Entrepreneurs and
The Capital Innovators.
Among those investors who will be in cars on Friday is Brian Dixon, program director for Capital Innovators, an
incubator program that operates in the T-Rex incubator downtown. The group is still looking for promising
companies to fill its Spring 2016 class.
The program focuses on information technology companies, offering $50,000 in startup funding in exchange for
equity - generally in the 5 percent to 10 percent range - in the company. Capital Innovators also offers mentoring,
networking and office space during the 12-week class.
It has invested in more than 50 companies since 2011.
